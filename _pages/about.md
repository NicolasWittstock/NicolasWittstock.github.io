Welcome 

I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of Washington. 

My research focuses on the Comparative Political Economy of Advanced Capitalist Democracies (mostly the U.S. and Europe). 

My research focuses broadly on the intersection between technological change, economic development, and democracy and has been published or is forthcoming in Economic and Political Studies, South European Society and Politics, the Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy, and Election Studies. With Prof. Victor Menaldo I recently revised and resubmitted a short book project to Cambridge University Press, Elements Series.
