I am an incoming Postdoctoral Scholar in Technology and National Security at the UC Institute for Global Conflict and Cooperation. 

I study the political economy of technological change. My research has been published or is forthcoming in Cambridge University Press, Economic and Political Studies, South European Society and Politics, the Journal of Political Institutions and Political Economy, and Election Studies. 

My dissertation and current book project investigates the political causes and consequences of American clean energy innovation. 

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Washington in 2024.

You can find my CV, contact information, and other links on this website.
